# Linux-Custom-Resolutions
A script that adds custom resolutions and refresh rates for installations of Linux. The script was created for Linux Mint 21.2 but could work well with other distros.

Open a command-line window and enter "gtf" with the resolution and refresh rate desired such as "gtf 2560 1440 60".
The "xrandr" command can be used to determine the name of the display such as "HDMI-A-0".

The script can be added to "Startup Applications" so that the custom resolutions can be applied upon login. A delay of 3 to 5 seconds is recommended.

Information is provided in the script.
